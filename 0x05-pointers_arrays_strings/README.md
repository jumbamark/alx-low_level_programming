* **0-reset_to_98.c** - takes a pointer to an `int` as parameters and updates the value it points to to `98`
* **1-swap.c** -  function that swaps the values of two integers
* **2-strlen.c** - returns the length of a string
* **3-puts.c** - prints a string followed by anew line to `stdout`
    > standard library provides a similar function `puts`. Run `man
* **4-print_rev.c** - prints a string in reverse followed by a new line
* **5-rev_string.c** - reverses a string
* **6-puts2.c** - prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character followed by a new line
* **7-puts_half.c** - prints the half of a string followed by a new line
    > * function should print second half of a string
    > - If the numbers of characters is odd, the function should print the last `n` characters of the string , where `n = length_of_string -1) /2`
* **8-print_array.c** - prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line
    > * Prototype:` void print_array(int *a, int n)`;
    > - where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
    > * Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
    > - The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
* **9-strcpy.c** - copies the string pointed to by `src` including the terminating null byte (\0) to the buffer pointed to by `dest`
    > * Return value: the pointer to `dest`
