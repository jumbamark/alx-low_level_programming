* **0x02-functions_nested_loops** - prints `_putchar` followed by a new line
    > The program should return a new line
* **1-alphabet.c** - prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    > Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
* **2-print_alphabet_x10.c** - prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    > Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
* **3-islower.c** - checks for lowercase character.
    > Prototype: int _islower(int c);
* **4-isalpha.c** - checks for alphabetic character.
* **5-sign.c** - prints the sign of a number.
* **6-abs.c** - computes the absolute value of an integer.
    > FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.
* **7-print_last_digit.c** - function that prints the last digit of a number.
* **8-24_hours.c** -  function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* **9-times_table.c** - function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* **10-add.c** - function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* **11-print_to_98.c** - function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
    > * Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
    > - Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
    > * Numbers should be printed in order
    > - The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
    > * The last printed number should be 98
* **100-times_table.c** - prints the n times table, starting with 0.
    > * Prototype: void print_times_table(int n); 
    > - If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
* **101-natural.c** - program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line
* **102-fibonacci.c** - program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
    > The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space `, `
* **103-fibonacci.c** - program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line by considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000,
* **104-fibonacci.c** -  program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
