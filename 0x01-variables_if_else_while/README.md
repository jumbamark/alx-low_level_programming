### Tasks
* **0-positive_or_negative.c** - program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed
   > - variable n will store a different value each time it is executed
   >
   > * Output of the program should be:
   >> * If the number is greater than 0: *is positive*
   >> - If the number is 0: *is zero*
   >> * If the number is less than zero: *is negative*
* **1-last_digit.c** - assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
* **2-print_alphabet.c** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    > * You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
    >
    > - You can only use putchar twice in your code. All your code should be in the main functions
