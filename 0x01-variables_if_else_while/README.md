### Tasks
* **0-positive_or_negative.c** - program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed
   > - variable n will store a different value each time it is executed
   >
   > * Output of the program should be:
   >> * If the number is greater than 0: *is positive*
   >> - If the number is 0: *is zero*
   >> * If the number is less than zero: *is negative*
* **1-last_digit.c** - assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
* **2-print_alphabet.c** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    > * You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
    >
    > - You can only use putchar twice in your code. All your code should be in the main functions
* **3-print_alphabets.c** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
 > You can only use the putchar function 
* **4-print_alphabt.c** - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* **5-print_numbers.c** - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* **6-print_numberz.c** - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* **7-print_tebahpla.c** - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
* **8-print_base16.c** - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* **9-print_comb.c** - program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
    > * Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    >
    > - Numbers should be printed in ascending order
    >
    > * You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
* **100-print_comb3.c** 
* **101-print_comb4.c**  -  prints all possible different combinations of three digits
    > * Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    > 
    > - The three digits must be different
    > 
    > * 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
    > 
    > - Print only the smallest combination of three digits
    > 
    > * Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
    >
    > - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
* **102-print_comb5.c**  - prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers 
    > * The numbers should range from 0 to 99
    > 
    > - The two numbers should be separated by a space
    > 
    > * All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
    > 
    > - The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
    > 
    > * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
    >
    > - 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
