- **0-create_array.c** - function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with specific char
- **1-strdup.c** - Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
> * The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
> - On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available
- **2-str_concat.c** - concatenates two strings
> * The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
> - if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
> * The function should return NULL on failure
- **3-alloc_grid.c** - returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- **4-free_grid.c** - frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
- **100-argstostr.c** - concatenates all the arguments of your program.
- **101-strtow.** - splits a string into words.
> * Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
> - The last element of the returned array should be NULL
> * Words are separated by spaces
